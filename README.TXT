Please compile the program using the following command: 
javac items/*.java worldobjects/*.java gui/*.java sprites/*.java creation/*.java *.java

You can run the program normally.
It sometimes takes a long time to compile and run.

I have 3 quests because after I completed the first two quests, 
I felt like the story would be better told with a third one.
